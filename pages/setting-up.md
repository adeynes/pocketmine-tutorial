# Setting up your environment
First of all, you of course need a server to test your plugins. Setting one up is out of the scope of this tutorial, and there are many tutorials out there. Please not that PocketMine does not support 32-bit devices, so even if you somehow manage to get a server running on your phone, you won't receive support if your plugins aren't working. (Hint: they're not working because you're on an unsupported device!)

Next: writing the code for your plugins. PocketMine doesn't require any specific editors, so you can use whatever code editor or IDE you like best. However, PhpStorm is often considered the most complete IDE for PHP and will facilitate your workflow greatly.

You will want to download the latest PocketMine release from the [release page](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/releases) and add that as an include path to your project so that your editor can perform auto-completion for the PocketMine API.
