# PocketMine-MP
[PocketMine](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) is a server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
It has an API for plugin development, but it's often overwhelming for beginners to get started. This site is a good starting point to get your feet wet with the API. PocketMine is written in PHP, so make sure you have a good foundation of that before you get started.
